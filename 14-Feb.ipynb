    "Advantages of Multithreading:-             \n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which can lead to improved performance and faster execution times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Better resource utilization: By dividing a program into multiple threads, multithreading allows better utilization of available resources, such as CPU time and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased responsiveness: Multithreading can help to keep a program responsive by allowing tasks to be performed in the background while the user continues to interact with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified program design: Multithreading can simplify program design by allowing different tasks to be separated into different threads, which can make it easier to write and maintain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program, making it more difficult to write and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Race conditions: When multiple threads access shared resources, there is a risk of race conditions, where the behavior of the program depends on the order in which threads are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deadlocks: Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a situation where no thread can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Overhead: Multithreading can incur additional overhead, such as the need to synchronize access to shared resources and the cost of creating and managing multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, multithreading can provide significant benefits in terms of performance, resource utilization, and program design, but it can also introduce complexity, race conditions, deadlocks, and additional overhead. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of multithreading when designing and implementing concurrent programs.\n",

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, resulting in a situation where no thread can proceed. Deadlocks are typically caused by a circular wait, where each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread in the cycle. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and debug, as the program may appear to be stuck, with no obvious indication of the cause. \n",

Race conditions typically occur when multiple threads attempt to access shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization. Race conditions can result in bugs and errors that are difficult to reproduce and debug.\n",
    "       For example, consider two threads, T1 and T2, attempting to increment a shared variable, count:In this case, the behavior of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute. If thread 1 and thread 2 both read the value of count as 5 and attempt to increment it at the same time, the resulting value may be incorrect (either 6 or 7, depending on which thread executes first). To avoid race conditions, access to shared resources must be properly synchronized using techniques such as locks or semaphores."
