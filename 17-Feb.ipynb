    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, semi-structured JSON-like documents. It is designed to scale horizontally across many servers and to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is open-source software and is available under the GNU Affero General Public License.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model of tables with fixed columns and rows. Instead, they use flexible document-based or key-value data models that allow for more efficient and scalable storage of unstructured or semi-structured data. Non-relational databases can be faster and more flexible than traditional SQL databases, but they can also be more complex to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data that does not fit well into a traditional SQL database schema.\n",
    "2. You need to be able to scale horizontally across many servers to handle large amounts of data or high traffic volumes.\n",
    "3. You need to be able to query and analyze data in real-time, without the need for complex joins or aggregations.\n",
    "4. You want a flexible, schema-less data model that can be easily modified and updated without requiring changes to the database schema.\n",
    "5. You are developing applications that require high availability and fault tolerance, as MongoDB is designed to support replication and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In summary, MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a flexible, scalable, and fast alternative to traditional SQL databases for storing and managing unstructured or semi-structured data. Non-relational databases are generally preferred in scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and performance are more important than strict data consistency and adherence to a fixed schema.\n",

    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is designed to store and manage large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data as flexible, semi-structured documents in a BSON format (a binary representation of JSON). This makes it easy to store and retrieve data in a format that closely matches the data structures used by applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema-less: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema, which means that you can add or remove fields from a document without having to modify the entire collection or schema. This makes it easy to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible querying: MongoDB provides a powerful query language that supports a wide range of operations, including ad-hoc queries, aggregation, and geospatial queries. It also supports indexing to speed up query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replication and Sharding: MongoDB supports replication and sharding, which allows you to scale your database horizontally across multiple servers or clusters. This provides high availability and automatic failover in case of hardware or network failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ad hoc queries: MongoDB allows you to perform ad hoc queries on data using a query language that is similar to SQL. You can use a range of operators and functions to filter, sort, and group data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Automatic sharding: MongoDB automatically distributes data across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. High performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance and scalability, and is able to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, MongoDB provides a range of powerful features that make it a popular choice for managing large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
