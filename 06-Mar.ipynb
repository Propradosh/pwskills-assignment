    "Central tendency and variability are two important aspects of summarizing a dataset. Measures of central tendency provide information about the center or typical value of a dataset, while measures of variability provide information about the spread or dispersion of the data. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values, or outliers, and can be influenced by them. The mean is commonly used to describe a normally distributed dataset, where the values are evenly distributed around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset, with half of the observations below it and half above it. The median is a robust measure of central tendency and is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. The median is commonly used to describe datasets with skewed distributions or extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. The mode is used to describe datasets with discrete values or values that cluster around a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range provides a rough estimate of the spread of the data, but is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: The variance is a measure of the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance is useful for describing datasets with normally distributed values, but is influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is a commonly used measure of variability. It indicates how much the values deviate from the mean, with higher values indicating more variability. The standard deviation is useful for describing normally distributed datasets and is less sensitive to outliers than the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of central tendency and variability are important tools for summarizing and describing a dataset. They provide information about the typical value of the data and the degree of variation or spread around that value. The choice of measure depends on the nature of the dataset and the research question of interest."
