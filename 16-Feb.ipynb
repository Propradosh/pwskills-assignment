    "A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. It is designed to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently and accurately. Databases can be used to store data related to various fields such as business, finance, education, healthcare, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standard language used to manage relational databases. SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is stored in tables that are related to each other through common fields or keys. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not follow the relational model. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph, or column-family. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and can scale horizontally more easily than SQL databases. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, whereas NoSQL databases use various data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema, which defines the structure of the data, whereas NoSQL databases are schemaless or have a flexible schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, while SQL databases scale vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query language: SQL databases use SQL as their query language, while NoSQL databases have their own query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Consistency: SQL databases enforce strong consistency, while NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency, which means that the data may not be immediately consistent across all nodes in the database cluster."

    "To create a new table called \"customers\" with columns \"customer_id\", \"customer_name\", \"customer_email\", and \"customer_phone\", we can use the following CREATE statement:\n",

    "2. DROP: This command is used to delete an entire database object, such as a table or index.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "To delete a table called \"customers\", we can use the following DROP statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",

    "3. ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table or column.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "To add a new column called \"customer_address\" to the \"customers\" table, we can use the following ALTER statement:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "ADD customer_address VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all data from a table, but it does not delete the table structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "To delete all data from the \"customers\" table, we can use the following TRUNCATE statement:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",

A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, where the values in one table correspond to the values in another table. This relationship is often used to link data between tables and create queries that retrieve related data. For example, a foreign key might be used to link a customer ID in an order table to the customer ID in a customer table. Foreign keys can be used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that data in one table is consistent with data in another table. If a foreign key constraint is defined, the database will prevent data from being inserted or updated in a way that violates the referential integrity constraint."
