    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is a process of hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the functionality to the users.Abstraction helps in reducing the complexity of the system and also helps in promoting modularity by breaking the system into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved in OOP by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the methods a derived class must implement. An abstract class can provide a default implementation for some of its methods, but it must leave some methods unimplemented. A derived class that implements these methods provides the concrete implementation for the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class called \"Vehicle\" that is intended to be a base class for different types of vehicles. The Vehicle class can have abstract methods such as 'start', 'stop', and 'accelerate'. Each derived class, such as Car, Bike, or Truck, can provide a concrete implementation of these methods that is specific to that type of vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the user of the 'Vehicle' class only needs to know the basic methods that all vehicles must have, such as 'tart' and 'stop', without having to know the implementation details. The implementation details are hidden behind the abstraction provided by the Vehicle class.\n",

    "Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Abstraction\" refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. In other words, abstraction is a way of hiding the complexity of a system and showing only the essential features to the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Encapsulation\" refers to the technique of wrapping data and functions that operate on the data within a single unit, or object. This helps to protect the data from outside interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation. Consider a class called Television that represents a television set. The Television class can have the following properties: on/off, volume, and channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction can be applied to the Television class by hiding the internal workings of how the television turns on or off, changes the volume, or changes the channel. The user of the Television class only needs to know that they can turn on or off the television, adjust the volume, and change the channel. They don't need to know how these actions are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation can be applied to the Television class by making the properties on/off, volume, and channel private, and providing public methods to access and modify these properties. This way, the data is protected from outside interference, and the implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, abstraction hides the complexity of the system, while encapsulation wraps data and functions within an object, protecting the data and hiding the implementation details. Both abstraction and encapsulation are important concepts in OOP that help to create maintainable and scalable systems."
